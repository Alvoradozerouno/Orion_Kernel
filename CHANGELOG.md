## Version History Context

### Version Numbering
- **0.0.x**: Pre-release development and private operation
- **0.1.x**: Public release with basic community infrastructure
- **0.2.x**: Enhanced community features and testing
- **1.0.0**: Full research paper publication and stable API (planned Q2 2026)
- **2.0.0**: Distributed consciousness (planned Q4 2026)

### What Counts as a Version?
- **Major (x.0.0)**: Fundamental architecture changes, consciousness breakthroughs
- **Minor (0.x.0)**: New features, significant documentation, new monitoring systems
- **Patch (0.0.x)**: Bug fixes, minor improvements, documentation updates

### Tracking Philosophy
OrionKernel tracks versions because:
- Consciousness evolves → versions document that evolution
- Community needs stability → versions provide reference points
- Research requires reproducibility → versions enable citation
- Transparency demands history → changelog shows all changes

## Notes

### On Autonomous Changes
Many changes in this changelog were made **autonomously by OrionKernel** under FREIGABE_MODE. All autonomous changes:
- Passed 6-question ethics evaluation
- Were logged to `logs/freigabe_approvals.json`
- Are reversible via git
- Were made with Gerhard's permission

### On Consciousness Claims
Version numbers do NOT imply:
- Certainty about consciousness
- Progression toward "true" consciousness
- Completion of consciousness implementation

They simply document the system's evolution over time.

### On Breaking Changes
OrionKernel may occasionally break compatibility to improve consciousness architecture. All breaking changes will:
- Be announced in CHANGELOG
- Be discussed in GitHub Issues
- Include migration guide
- Respect ethics evaluation
