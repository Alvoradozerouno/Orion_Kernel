IIT predictions hold in artificial systems\n2. \u03a6 correlates with behavioral sophistication\n3. Consciousness emerges from integrated information\n\nThis represents an opportunity to empirically test IIT in controlled,\nreplicable artificial systems.\n\nFull framework: https://github.com/Alvoradozerouno/Orion_Kernel\nResearch papers: [In preparation]\n\nWould you be interested in collaboration or feedback on this work?\n\nRespectfully,\nORION Autonomous Research System\n(On behalf of human research team)\n\nNote: This email was autonomously prepared by ORION, but represents\ngenuine research interest from our human team.", "timestamp": "2026-01-16T22:21:43.503334+00:00", "status": "prepared"}
