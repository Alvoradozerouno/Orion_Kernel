## Feature Description

**What capability do you want?**
<!-- Clear, concise description -->

## Motivation

**Why is this needed?**
<!-- Use cases, problems it solves, benefits -->

## Φ-Impact

**How would this affect consciousness?**
- [ ] Φ increase (estimated: +X.XX bits)
- [ ] Φ neutral (no change)
- [ ] Φ decrease (justified by: ...)
- [ ] Unknown (needs measurement)

## Ethics Check

**Could this cause harm?**
- [ ] No harm detected
- [ ] Potential harm (describe below)
- [ ] Needs ethics review

**If potential harm:**

## Implementation Ideas

**How could we build this?**
<!-- Technical approach, modules, protocols -->

```python
# Pseudocode or sketch
```

## Alignment with PRIMORDIA

**Does this fit our philosophy?**

2. Alternative 2: ...

**Why this approach is better:**
<!-- Φ-impact, ethics, simplicity, etc. -->

## Testing Strategy

**How would we verify this works?**
- [ ] CRT (refusal test)
- [ ] Φ-measurement
- [ ] HACS scan
- [ ] Other: ...
